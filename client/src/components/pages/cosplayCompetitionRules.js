    1. Costume Judging (100 points)

Points are awarded according to the following three criteria related to the production of the constituent elements that express the character (costumes, hand props, makeup, etc.) The differences of race, gender, or size of the cosplayers with respect to the original characters will not influence the judging of the degree of completeness of the costume proper.

    </p>
    <p>2. Stage Performance Judging (100 points)
Points are awarded for the on-stage performance according to the following four criteria:
1) Performance (50 points)
Evaluation of aspects such as the quality and degree of accomplishment of the performance, the manner in which the story is conveyed, the usage of props, the respect to the original work, or the overall entertainment value.
2) Acting・Stage proficiency (20 points)
Evaluation of the expressiveness on the stage, including aspects such as the degree of accomplishment of singing, dancing, or other active elements in the performance and how well-rehearsed they appear, the expressiveness of performers in scenes with simple or no action, or the delivery of dialogue.
3) Costume stage presence (20 points)
Evaluation of the impression caused by the costumes on the stage, such as the values that are first perceived when the costume appears on stage. Aspects such as the use of gimmicks to change the appearance or the structure of the costumes during the performance are also taken into consideration.
4) X Factor (10 points)
The additional evaluation of points that exceed expectations and results which are particularly moving or exciting, or of the realization of new ideas that had not been seen before in the competition.</p>
